# SecureDocCompare - Frontend Service

## Overview

`SecureDocCompare` is the frontend user interface and secure proxy for the BAW Document Comparison system. It provides a web-based dashboard for users to upload documents, manage comparisons, and review results.

### Key Responsibilities:

-   **User Interface:** Provides a web dashboard for interacting with the comparison service.
-   **Authentication:** Secures the document comparison process through a session-based login system.
-   **API Proxy:** Acts as a secure gateway to the backend `UslugaDoPorownan` service. It forwards API requests from the authenticated frontend to the backend, which runs on a separate port.
-   **Summary Editor:** Provides a user interface for reviewing, editing, and approving document change summaries generated by the n8n workflow.

## API

This service acts primarily as a proxy. Most of its API endpoints require user authentication and forward requests to the `UslugaDoPorownan` backend.

For a complete overview of the entire system architecture and a detailed description of all API endpoints (both frontend and backend), please refer to the main project documentation:
